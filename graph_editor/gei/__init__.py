"""The gei model, generated over dsviper.

Each DSM namespace is a module holding its structures, enumerations and keys, and its
attachments as `attachments`:
`gei.graph`.
`containers` holds one class per container shape the model uses, in a structure, an
attachment or a pool; another shape is built with the runtime, from Viper values:
`dsviper.Value.create(dsviper.TypeSet(gei.graph.EdgeKey.type()), [k.unwrap_value() for k in keys])`.
`definitions()` is the model.
The pools, rendered with the Pool feature, are imported by their path:
`import gei.tools`, `import gei.model_graph`, `import gei.model_integrity`, `import gei.model_selection`.

A document is stored in a dsviper database that knows the model, and read and written
through an attachment, given the database or a state:

    db = dsviper.Database.create_in_memory()     # a CommitDatabase keeps every commit
    db.extend_definitions(gei.definitions())
    db.begin_transaction()
    gei.graph.attachments.Edge.topology.set(db, key, document)
    db.commit()

A generated object is a box around a Viper value: `p.unwrap_value()` gives it, and
`Cls.wrap_value(value)` boxes one. A runtime feature is called on that value: bytes are
`dsviper.Value.encode(p.unwrap_value())`, read back with
`Cls.wrap_value(dsviper.Value.decode(blob, Cls.type(), definitions(), encoded=False))`, which
asks for the Viper value rather than natives. wrap_value or a constructor given a Viper value of
another type raises TypeError; the rest is the runtime's to refuse, with dsviper.ViperError:
content that does not fit, native or generated, in a field, a container or an attachment.
